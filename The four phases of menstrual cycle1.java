The four phases of menstrual cycle:1)Menstruation,2)the follicular phase,3)ovulation,4)luteal phase


	1)Menstruation phase:The first stage of the menstrual cycle, it's also when you get your period. This phase starts when an egg from the previous cycle is not fertilized. Because pregnancy hasn't taken place,levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone drop.
The thickened lining of your uterus, which would support a pregnancy, is no longer needed,so it sheds through your vagina.
	During your period, you release a combination of blood, mucus, and tissue from your uterus.
 You may have period symptoms like these:
*cramps * tender breasts * bloating *mood swings * irritability * headaches * tiredness * low back pain.


2)Follicular phase:Phase two out of the four menstrual cycle phases is the follicular phase. This phase starts on the first day of your period(so there is some overlap with the menstrual phase) and ends when you ovulate.
	It starts when the hypothalamus signals your pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH) This hormone stimulates your ovaries to produce around 5 to 20 small sacs called follicles. Each follicle contains an immature egg.
  Only the healthiest egg will eventually mature.(On rare occassions, a female may have two eggs mature.) The rest of the follicles will be reabsorbed into your body.
   The maturin follicle sets off a surge in estrogen that thickens the lining of your uterus.This creates a nutrient-rich environment for an embryo to grow.
  	 The average follicular phase lasts for about 16 days.It can range from 11 to 27 days, depending on your cycle.

3)  Ovulation phase:
	   Rising estrogen levels during the follicular phase trigger your pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH). This is what starts the process of ovulation.
		Ovulation  is when your ovary releases a mature egg. The egg travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus to be fertilizes by sperm.

     The Ovulation phase is the time during your menstrual cycle when you can get pregnant. You can tell that you're ovulating by symptoms like these:
* a Slight rise in basal body temperature
* thicker discharge that has the texture of egg whites

      Ovulation happens around day 14  if you hava a 28 - day cycle - right in the middle of your menstrual cycle . It lasts about 24 hours.After a day, the egg will die or dissolve if it isn't fertilized. 
NOTE: Beacause sperm can live up to 5 days, pregnancy can occur as a result of sex 5 days before ovulation.


4) Luteal phase:
	After the follicle releases its egg, it changes into the corpus luteum. This structure releases hormones, mainly progesterone and some estrogen. The rise in hormones keeps your uterine linig thick .
    If you don't get pregnant, the corpus luteum will shrink away and be resorbed.
   This leads to decreased levels of estrogen and progesterone, which causes the onset of your period.

    During this phase, if you don't get pregnant, you may experience symptoms of premenstrual syndrome(PMS). These include:
   *bloating * breast swelling,pain or tenderness * mood changes * headache * weight pain * changes in sexual desire * food cravings * trouble sleeping.
	The luteal phase lasts for 11 to 17 days . The average length is 14 days.












    		TO CALCULATE OVULATION PERIOD :
		The length of your menstrual cycle is the number of days from the first day of bleeding in your last period, to the first day of bleeding in your next. From this figure, subtract 14 days from the end of your current cycle to determine the approximate day you ovulate.
 

	 	TO CALCULATE MENSTRUATION CYCLE:
			To do a general estimate of when your next period is coming, count 28 days from the first day of your last period. 
	However,28 days is only an average, so the number varies from girl to girl.
	What's more helpful is to work out the average for your individual menstrual cycle.

		Normal  menstruation cycle lengths can range between 21 and 35 days. In order to calculate the number of days in a cycle, one needs to  keep track of when you get your period for a while.Here's how it works.

 		 Step1: Mark the first dayof your period in the calendar. The first day of your period is Day1 of your menstrual cycle. Do this for a few months, and you'll be one step closer to figuring out the average time between your periods.
		Step2: Add up the number of days in each cycle after you've marked your period on the calendar for a few months. Then, divide this number by the number of periods you've had in this time. This will give you your average cycle length(i.e.,the average time between your periods).
		Step3:Now that you have this number, figuring out the when your next period is due should be as easy as pie. Starting on the first day of your last period, just count forward the average number of days between your periods that you calculated in Step2. This will give you the projected start date of your next period.   
		TO CALCULATE SAFE PERIOD:
	1)For 8 to 12 months, record the day you start your menstrual period and count the total number of days in that cycle.
	Note that the first full flow day of your menstrual period is day 1.
	2) Then write down the longest and shortest number of days from your monthly tracking.
	3)Find out the last day of your fertile window by subtracting 18 days from the length of your shortest cycle. For example,if your shortest cycle was 27 days, subtract 18 from 27, and write down day 9.
	4)Find out the last day of your fertile window by subtracting 11 from the length of the longest cycle. For example, if the longest cycle length was 30 days, you'd get day 19.
	5) The time between the shortest and longest day is your fertile window. In the above example, it would be between days 9 and 19. If you're trying to avoid pregnancy. It's important to avoid having sex without a condom or other barrier methods during those days.
